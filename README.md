# Categorical Image Recognition using Fastai

This project is a categorical image recognition model built using Fastai and ResNet architecture. It includes steps to download images, preprocess them, and train a model to classify images into multiple categories.

## Project Structure

- `categorial-image-recognition-fastai.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the model training and evaluation code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waijian1/categorial-image-recognition-fastai.git
   cd categorial-image-recognition-fastai
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook categorial-image-recognition-fastai.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Run the notebook to download images, preprocess data, train the model, and perform categorical image recognition.
